# Using Coaching Insights

Learn how to interpret and apply coaching recommendations from Call Coach.

## Understanding Your Analysis

When you analyze a call, you receive detailed feedback across four dimensions. This guide explains what each element means and how to use it.

## Dimension Details

### Discovery (Learning Customer Needs)

**What we measure:**

- How well you identified customer challenges
- Quality of qualifying questions
- Understanding of decision criteria
- Exploration of pain points
- Connection to customer's business

**Score interpretation:**

**90-100: Excellent Discovery**

- Deeply understood customer needs
- Asked great qualifying questions
- Uncovered all key pain points
- Clear understanding of business impact
- Customer felt heard and understood

Example strong discovery:

```
"What's your current workflow for managing data pipelines?"
"How long does that process typically take?"
"What's the impact on your team when this fails?"
"Who else is involved in the decision?"
"What timeline are you working with?"
```

**80-89: Good Discovery**

- Solid understanding of needs
- Asked most important questions
- Minor gaps in exploration
- Could go deeper on timeline/budget

Improvement opportunity:

```
You asked about pain points but didn't explore timeline
Add: "When do you need this resolved?"
```

**70-79: Average Discovery**

- Identified main pain point
- Missed deeper exploration
- Could qualify better
- Didn't fully understand decision process

Recommended focus:

```
Add discovery questions about:
1. Current solution details
2. Budget and timeline
3. Other stakeholders involved
4. Evaluation criteria
```

**Below 70: Needs Improvement**

- Missed key discovery elements
- Moved to product discussion too early
- Didn't fully understand customer
- Recommend coaching before next calls

Action steps:

```
1. Review discovery question framework
2. Practice discovery scenarios
3. Shadow top performer
4. Do mock discovery calls
5. Get manager feedback
```

### Product Knowledge (Demonstrating Expertise)

**What we measure:**

- Accurate feature explanations
- Relevant use case examples
- Competitive positioning

Strengths to maintain:

```
"You explained our workflow automation clearly"
"Great example comparing their use case to similar customer"
"Strong technical depth on API capabilities"
```

**80-89: Strong Product Knowledge**

- Accurately answered questions
- Generally relevant examples
- Some positioning gaps
- Could be more technical in places

Areas to develop:

- Confused customer further

Immediate action:

```
1. Complete product certification
2. Shadow product expert
3. Practice before next calls
4. Get manager coaching
```

### Objection Handling (Overcoming Concerns)

**What we measure:**

- Keeping momentum moving forward

**Score interpretation:**

**90-100: Expert Objection Handling**

- Understood objection deeply
- Responded with confidence and evidence
- Customer concerns addressed
- Maintained relationship
- Moved deal forward

Example strong response:

```
Objection: "Your solution is too expensive"
Response: "I understand budget is important. Let's look
at your current costs. If you're spending $300K annually
on your current solution, Horizon actually reduces that
to $150K, paying for itself in implementation savings alone."
```

**80-89: Good Objection Handling**

- Addressed main concern
- Could add more evidence
- Slight positioning gap
- Overall effective

Improvement idea:

```
Add: "Let me show you the ROI calculation"
Add: "Here's how similar customers handled this"
```

**70-79: Moderate Handling**

- Partially addressed objection
- Defensive tone possible
- Didn't fully resolve concern
- Relationship slightly damaged

Development needed:

```
1. Objection handling training
2. Practice with role-play
3. Prepare objection responses
4. Learn competitor positioning
5. Practice staying consultative
```

**Below 70: Struggled with Objection**

- Didn't address concern
- Became defensive
- Customer unconvinced
- Deal risk increased

Recommended coaching:

```
1. Complete objection handling certification
2. Shadow objection handling expert
3. Role-play different objections
4. Practice value-based responses
5. Build confidence framework
```

**Common objections and handling strategies:**

**Pricing Objection**

```
Objection: "You're more expensive than [competitor]"
Response: "Let me explain the difference. While our
price is higher, we include [feature], [feature],
which competitor lacks. Over 3 years, total cost
of ownership is actually lower. Here's the breakdown..."
```

**Technical Objection**

```
Objection: "Will this integrate with our [system]?"
Response: "Great question. We have pre-built connectors
for [system]. Let me show you how they work and what
data flows between systems."
```

**Timeline Objection**

```
Objection: "We're not ready to implement until Q3"
Response: "That timeline makes sense. What if we did a
3-week proof of concept now to validate fit? That way
you're ready to scale when Q3 arrives."
```

**Competitive Objection**

```
Objection: "[Competitor] can do the same thing cheaper"
Response: "I hear you. Let me show you what [Competitor]
actually provides. As you'll see, they don't include
[key feature]. That means [business impact]. Our
customers chose us for these exact differentiators."
```

**Example complete analysis:**

```
DISCOVERY: 82/100 (↑ Improving +5 points)

KEY FINDINGS:
Strengths:
✓ Asked about current data pipeline process
✓ Identified key pain point (manual data validation)
✓ Explored impact on team efficiency

Opportunities:
→ Could explore timeline and budget constraints earlier
→ Didn't ask about other stakeholders in decision

At 12:00 - "Have you looked at other solutions?" (could follow with budget Q)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Immediate:
1. Add timeline question after pain point
   Suggested: "When would you need this running?"
2. Ask about decision stakeholders
   Suggested: "Who else needs to sign off on this?"
3. Explore evaluation criteria
   Suggested: "What's most important to your team?"

Longer-term:
1. Study high-performing discovery calls (90+)
   Find: 3 calls with 90+ discovery scores
2. Practice discovery framework
   Time: 30 min / week for 2 weeks
3. Shadow top performer
   Schedule: Ask manager to pair with Sarah

## Applying Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

After analyzing a call, take 1-2 immediate actions:

1. **Identify the top gap**

   - What's the single biggest opportunity?
   - What would most improve your score?

2. **Choose one action**

   - Don't try to change everything
   - Focus on impact
   - Build on success

3. **Practice it**
   - Role-play before next call
   - Write out your new question/response
   - Say it out loud
   - Get feedback from manager

Example:

```
Call analyzed: Discovery call, score 82
Gap: Didn't ask about timeline/budget
Action: Add two questions to discovery discovery
New questions:
1. "When do you need this running?" (after pain point)
2. "What budget have you allocated for this?" (after exploring pain)

Practice:
- Write out exact wording
- Practice saying it naturally 5x
- Ask manager to role-play
- Use in next 2 calls
```

## Working with Your Manager

### Sharing Analysis with Manager

1. **Schedule coaching session**

   - Share specific call analysis
   - Focus on 1-2 dimensions
   - Discuss action plan

2. **Use evidence**

   - Reference specific quotes
   - Show scoring methodology
   - Discuss recommendations together

3. **Set expectations**
   - Agree on goals
   - Define success metrics
   - Establish coaching timeline

Example coaching conversation:

```
Manager: "Let's look at your discovery score. You got 82,
which is good, but I see opportunities in timeline/budget
exploration."

You: "Yeah, I noticed that too. In this call [timestamp],
I asked about their process but didn't follow up on timeline
or budget. I was thinking I should add those questions earlier,
right after understanding the pain point."

Manager: "Exactly. Let me show you how Sarah structures it.
She asks about pain, impact, timeline, then budget before
diving into product. Want to practice that together?"

You: "Yes, that would help. Should I use those exact questions?"

Manager: "Use them as a framework, but make them natural to
your style. Let's role-play. I'll be the customer."
```

### Using for Performance Reviews

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my score different than I expected?**
A: Claude analyzes the full conversation, not just outcomes. A call you thought went well might have missed key discovery questions. Review the evidence to understand the reasoning.

**Q: Can I dispute a score?**
A: Scores are Claude's assessment of what happened in the call. Review the evidence, discuss with your manager, and use for learning. If you think there's an error, contact support with specific feedback.

**Q: How often should I review calls?**
A: Ideally within 24 hours while fresh. Weekly review of 3-5 calls helps you see patterns. Monthly deep dives with your manager for coaching.

**Q: Should I share analyses with my team?**
A: Yes! High-scoring calls are great learning tools. Ask permission from the rep, share good examples, discuss what made them successful.

**Q: How does coaching translate to results?**
A: Better call performance should lead to:

- Higher win rates
- Larger deal sizes
- Faster sales cycles
- Customer satisfaction
- Advancement opportunities

See results in 2-4 weeks with focused effort on one dimension.
