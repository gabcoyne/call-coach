### 3. Key Insights

AI-generated observations about your performance this week.

**Example**:

```
Key Insights:

1. Product Knowledge Strength ⭐
   Your product knowledge is your strongest dimension
   at 89/100 and improving week-over-week. This is
   above team average and a key competitive advantage
   in discovery and demo calls.

2. Objection Handling Gap
   Your objection handling (77) is below team average
   (79) and stable rather than improving. You've handled
   5 objections this week with mixed results:
   - Pricing objections: 70/100 (weak)
   - Technical objections: 82/100 (strong)
   Action: Focus specifically on value-based pricing
   responses.

3. Engagement Improvement 📈
   Great news! Your engagement score improved 4 points
   this week (from 82 to 86). You're using more
   customer language and showing better active
   listening. Keep this momentum!

4. Discovery vs Engagement Trade-off
   Your discovery score declined while engagement
   improved. Both are important - balance asking
   qualifying questions with relationship building.
